Imagine we already have a trained latent diffusion model. Meaning we have a model that predicts the noise of a given intermediate step so that the final image can be restored.
Create a pseudode to estimate the likelihood of the current diffusion prediction. Meaning, estimate the score value that diffusion uses for the current prediction training. Obviously, we don't know the final image.
This should take into consideration logic and methematical knowledge and diffusion theory knowledge.
